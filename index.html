            <img src="profile.png" alt="Aaron Piando" class="profile-img">
            
            <p>
                I'm a senior at Boston University with a passion for technology, community engagement, and social innovation. 
                Born and raised in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas, I carry with me the values and perspectives shaped by 
                my identity as a second-generation Filipino American who grew up in a border community.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work spans software development, machine learning, data analytics, and leadership roles that empower others 
                and drive meaningful change. Whether through building tools for educational access, analyzing data for social 
                impact, or leading community initiatives, I strive to use technology as a force for good.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I look ahead, I am seeking opportunities in the tech industry that align with a strong sense of purpose. 
                I hope to apply my skills to projects that advance equity, foster community empowerment, and create positive 
                social outcomes.
